#This is a controller I wrote using Zend Framework 1.0

It was written a few years ago when I was learning the Zend Framework. However, I did not release any production
code with it, as I wandered off and dit some online marketing, WordPress, and then finally decided to pick up
Laravel instead of Zend Fraemwork again. However, the experience of dabbling with Zend Framework provided me with
hands on experience using an MVC framework (routes, model, ORM, etc).
